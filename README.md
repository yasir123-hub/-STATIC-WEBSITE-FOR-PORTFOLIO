#DESCRIPTION
As part of my internship, I developed a static and responsive portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of this task was to create a professional web presence for a developer, showcasing key sections such as an introduction, about me, skills, projects, and contact information. The website is designed as a single-page layout with a clean and modern interface. The homepage features the developer's name and a short tagline, followed by a section that briefly introduces the developer’s background and interests in web development. The skills section displays a responsive grid of technologies including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and version control tools like Git. The projects section highlights example work with a title, description, and a link to view each project. The contact section lists the developer’s email for communication. To ensure usability on all devices, I implemented responsive design using CSS media queries, allowing the layout to adjust smoothly on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. Google Fonts were used for improved typography, and visual design was enhanced with color contrasts, spacing, and box shadows. A small JavaScript script was added to enable smooth scrolling between sections when clicking on navigation links. The website is lightweight, fast, and can be deployed on hosting platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify. This task helped me apply core web development concepts and gave me practical experience in creating clean, structured, and user-friendly front-end interfaces.
